## NPM Scripts
* Start develop server: `$ npm start`
* Create production build: `$ npm run build`
* Start server: `$ npm run server`
* Remove build folder: `$ npm run clean`
* Run ESLint: `$ npm run lint`
* Run webpack-bundle-analyzer: `$ npm run analyzer`

## Deployment
Make sure all modules are installed:
`$ npm install`

Create a build for production, this will add a `/dist` folder to the root with all bundles.
`$ npm run build`

Run the server file to start server:
`$ npm run server`

For production I recommend to use [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to run the server with advanced process management.

## Development Workflow
### Components
The components are separated in `Modules` and `Common`. Modules are bundled components which depend on each other. Common components are components that are self-contained and can be used through the entire app.

### Ducks
This boilerplate uses the [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) pattern for Redux, that means that the actionTypes, actions and reducers are bundled together in an isolated module.

### Redux DevTools
To use de Redux DevTools install the [Redux DevTools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) from the chrome webstore.
